A simple random option chooser, just for fun

## Install (for linux):

+ Extract it in `/your/path/choicemaker`
+ go to `/your/path`
+ open terminal there if it's not done already
+ type `sudo pip install choicemaker`
+ make a choices file (you can check the default location of the file by doing `choose --check`)
